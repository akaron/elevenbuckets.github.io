	We believe tokenization via programmable Blockchain has greater potential beyond “FinTech” applications such as payment or security. While often inevitably being dual-purposed as store of value, many tokens are created as symbols or emblems of participation that not only grant access to the associated dApps, but also enable sophiscated economic game theory for decentralized, self-regulated system governance, which makes them an essential and innovative element in Blockchain-based applications. </p>
	<p>
	It is also our belief that, unlike stocks of a company, tokens with dApp reaching its maturity would require stable market price to encourage token circulation that ties to dApp utilization, instead of merely possessing them for financial gain.</p>
